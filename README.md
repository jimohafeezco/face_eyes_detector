# Face and Eyes Detector
This repository contains code for detecting face and eyes from an image and a video



This project uses CaffeNet for detecting faces and Haar features for eyes detection in images and videos. The haar feature based detection is a method developed by Viola-Jones who are two ML researchers in the early 2001.

## What is Haar-Feature Object detection

Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
